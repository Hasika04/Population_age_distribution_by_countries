# Task 01 – Population Age Group Distribution (Top 10 Countries)

This project fulfills Task 01 of our data analysis series, where the objective was to visualize the distribution of a variable using a **bar chart or histogram**.
We chose to explore the **age group distribution across countries** using a publicly available dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the population of 252 countries segmented into the following age groups:

- 0–4 years  
- 5–14 years  
- 15–24 years  
- 25–64 years  
- 65+ years  
- Total population

## Objective

- Visualize the distribution of age groups across countries.
- Focus on the **top 10 countries by total population** for better clarity and interpretation.

---

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## Visualization

We used a **stacked bar chart** to compare how the population of each country is distributed across different age groups.

---

## Key Steps

1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Sorted countries by `Total` population.
3. Selected the **top 10 most populous countries**.
4. Created a **stacked bar chart** to compare age group composition.
5. Added insights based on the plot.

## Insights

- Most countries have a dominant population in the **25–64 years** age group.
- Developing nations like Afghanistan have a higher share in younger age groups (0–14 years), indicating high birth rates.
- Some smaller nations show aging trends, with a visible 65+ population.

## Conclusion

The stacked bar chart effectively highlights how population structure varies by country. By narrowing down to the **top 10 countries**, we created a clean and interpretable visualization.
